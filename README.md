I changed my final project from Hangman to Create Your Own Adventure.

You and your friends have a crazy, memorable night walking through the abandoned hospital in the Presidio. It's very unrealistic and I'll probably add more to the game as time goes on.

Thank you Paul (TA) for helping me create this game. Couldn't have done it without you. And of course, wouldn't have learned Python without Rachel. :)
