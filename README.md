Hangman

1. There can be one player or a group. 
2. Have the player select a letter of the alphabet.
3. If the letter is contained in the word/phrase, the player takes another turn guessing a letter. 
4. Click on the square with the appropiate letter in it to reveal the letter within the word/phrase.
5. Click on the letter in the alphabet area which will then trigger the letter to be revealed if it is contained in the word/phrase, or try again indicating that the letter is not contained in the word/phrase.
6. If the letter is not contained in the word/phrase, click the try again button, a portion of the hangman is added.
7. The game continues if the word/phrase is guessed (all letters are revealed, which is the winner) or until all parts of the hangman are displayed, which is the loser.
